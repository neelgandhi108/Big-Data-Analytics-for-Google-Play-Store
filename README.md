# Big-Data-Analytics-for-Google-Play-Store
## ABSTRACT


The Google Play Store hosts a vast collection of millions of apps that are downloaded and used by billions of users worldwide. When users browse or search for apps, they are presented with a list of options, each displaying the app name and its rating. Typically, users tend to gravitate towards highly rated apps, as they reflect user satisfaction. App developers employ various techniques and optimizations, apart from the inherent app quality, to obtain high ratings. These include using attractive app titles, compelling icons, and other strategies to enhance their app's rating. However, there is currently no scientific approach to determine the actual impact of employing such techniques on achieving higher ratings.

This project aims to investigate several factors related to Google Play Store apps and assess their influence using variable importance analysis. To accomplish this, we utilize a real-world dataset obtained from the Google Play Store to identify the significance of these factors. Random Forest, Linear Regression Model, and Support Vector Regression methods are employed to identify important variables. The models' performance is evaluated using standard evaluation techniques. Our findings reveal that certain factors hold greater significance and have a notable impact on app ratings. Additionally, we conduct keyword analysis to identify important words used in app titles that correlate with higher and lower ratings.

In this project, we perform an analysis and prediction on the Google Play Store application dataset collected from kaggle.com. Leveraging Big Data techniques, such as Hive, we explore the relationships among various attributes within the dataset, including whether an application is free or paid, user reviews, and application ratings. Furthermore, utilizing Deep Learning, we attempt to predict whether user reviews are positive or negative. By conducting this research, we aim to gain insights into the dynamics of the Google Play Store ecosystem and provide valuable information for app developers and users alike.

# Big-Data-Analytics-for-Google-Play-Store
##ABSTRACT


Google Play Store contains millions of Apps. These apps are downloaded and been used by millions
and billions of users. Whenever a user browse or search for apps on Play store, a list of apps are
shown to the user in which each app contains the app name along with its rating. Usually the user
prefers to download highly rated apps because highly rated apps reflect users’ satisfaction. In order
to gain high ratings, app developer uses different techniques and tweaks other than the app quality its
self. Developers use attractive app titles, demanding icons, and other things to gain better ratings for
their apps. However, there is no scientific approach to find the real impact of using attractive titles or
any other such thing in order to gain higher ratings. Therefore, in this paper, we examine a number of
factors of google play store apps and identify the influence of these factors using variable
importance. For this purpose, real-world Google Play store apps dataset is used in this paper to
identify the importance of these factors. For identification of important variables, Random Forest,
Linear Regression Model and Support Vector Regression are used. The performance of the model is
evaluated using standard performance evaluation techniques. The results show that some factors
have higher significance and influence the app ratings. Moreover, keyword analysis has taken place
to find the important words used in app title that results in higher and lower ratings. So in this
project, I have tried to perform analysis and prediction into the Google Play store application dataset
that I have collected from kaggle.com. Using Big Data techniques such as Hive I have tried to
discover the relationships among various attributes present in my dataset such as which application is
free or paid, about the user reviews, rating of the application. And using Deep Learning I have tried
to make a prediction about the user reviews that which review is positive or negative.
